  ## Anaconda
  <a href="http://anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> is a great tool to help you get started with Python! It will help you install Python, manage packages, and integrate with Jupyter Notebooks. 
  ## Required Libraries
  To run any of my programs, you will need to have the correct libraries installed. In the section for each algorithm I will list all required libraries. To install them, you can use conda (through the Anaconda command prompt), or pip, the native Python installer. For example, to install Pandas execute the following in the Anaconda prompt:
  

```
conda install -c anaconda pandas
```
