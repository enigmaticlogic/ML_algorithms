# Intro
Below is a a very brief overview of some projects I have worked on. Detailed documentation is included for ML_models and MWCG_project within their respective folders. The flavor of the other projects is similar to that of the MWCG project.

# Projects
ML_models: Various ML algorithms coded from scratch in Python. These scripts are runnable as is, and the relavant data set CSV's are included.

PDF's of all research papers are included.

MWCG_project: Code for reproduction of models used and predictions made from another research paper which employs graph theory techniques and kernel methods with ML models (RF, GBT, CNN) to predict bfactors of proteins with competitive accuracy. This project involved using the parallel computing power of the HPCC at MSU, and includes several Python scripts meant to be run on the HPCC.

DG_Project: Code for reproduction of models used and predictions made in a research paper which employs differential geometry techniques and ML algorithms to predict binding energy for protein ligand pairs with competitive accuracy. This project involved using the parallel computing power of the HPCC at MSU, and includes several Python scripts meant to be run on the HPCC.

FRI_projects/Rig_Project: Code for reproduction of models used and predictions made in various research papers which employ kernel methods and the notion of atomic fleibility to predict bfactors.
