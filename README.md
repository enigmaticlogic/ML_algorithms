# Projects
ML_models: Various ML algorithms coded from scratch in Python. These scripts are runnable as is, and the relavant data set CSV's are included.

PDF's of all research papers are included.

FRI_projects/Rig_Project: Code for reproduction of results from various research papers which use kernel methods and the notion of atomic fleibility to predict bfactors.

MWCG_project: Code for reproduction of results from another research paper which uses graph theory techniques and kernel methods with ML models (RF, GBT, CNN) to predict bfactors of proteins with competitive accuracy. This project involved using the parallel computing power of the HPCC at MSU, and includes several Python scripts meant to be run on the HPCC through an sbatch. 

DG_Project: Code for partial reproduction of results from a research paper which uses differential geometry techniques and ML algorithms to predict binding energy for protein ligand pairs with competitive accuracy. This project involved using the parallel computing power of the HPCC at MSU, and includes several Python scripts meant to be run on the HPCC through an sbatch.
